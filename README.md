This project is an end-to-end automation script that simulates a real user journey on the Demoblaze e-commerce site. It starts by opening the website in a Chrome browser, logging in with a test account, selecting the first available product, and adding it to the cart. After that, it navigates to the cart page, fills in the checkout form with dummy customer details, and completes the purchase. The script then prints the confirmation message to the console. The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to keep the code modular and easy to maintain, with separate classes for login, product selection, and cart handling. Everything runs from a main() method
